meteor-googlemaps-demo
======================

This is a sample application / experimentation ground for integrating
Google Maps Javascript API into a reactive Meteor JS application.

Nothing in this code is definitive but works to the best that I am able to
illustrate how to have dynamic markers that alter based on map extent.
